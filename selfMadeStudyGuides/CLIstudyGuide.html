<h1>CLI and how it applies</h1>
<h3>What is a CLI?</h3>
<p>
    CLI stands for Command Line Interface. But what does that really mean? CLI's are used for a lot of the basic needs when developing software, including installation of software and configuration of how you want your computer to be set up. It can be used to move through your folders and documents, and even to create new folders and documents. You're even able to write information into documents from the CLI.

<h3>So that's all we need? A CLI?</h3>
<p> While there are many things that a CLI can do on it's own, CLI's rely on things called package managers. Package managers are essential for installation and tracking of the software you have or want on your computer. It is kind of like a tool box that contains all of the tools and remembers which tools you have and helps you get new ones or remove old ones as you see fit.</p>
